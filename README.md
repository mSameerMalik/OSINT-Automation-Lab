# 🛰️ OSINT Lab – Reconnaissance with SpiderFoot & Recon-ng

> "You don’t need access to a system to own it. Sometimes, all it takes is what’s already out there."

## 🎯 Objective
Conduct an **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** investigation using automated recon tools to uncover publicly available data on a simulated target.

## 🔍 Tools Used
- 🕸️ **SpiderFoot** – for automated OSINT scanning and visualization
- 📦 **Recon-ng** – for modular, CLI-based OSINT reconnaissance

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Passive information gathering on domain names and IP addresses
- Correlating leaked data from breaches with social presence
- Building a comprehensive target profile without touching the system
- Extracting relationships between digital identities

## 📁 Artifacts
- Lab documentation with module usage and screenshots
- Structured observations of discovered data points
- Ethical reflections on exposed intelligence
